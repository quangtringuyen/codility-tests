## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Use Your Web App

**After each lesson**:
1. Mark day as completed ✅
2. Note challenges completed
3. Add personal notes about difficulty
4. Track mock test scores

**Goal tracking**:
- Week 2: 70%+ on mock test
- Week 3: 75%+ on mock test
- Week 4: 80%+ on mock test
- Week 5: 80-85%+ on mock test
- Week 6: 85%+ on mock test
- Week 8: 85-90%+ overall

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results

**Do**:
✅ Solve problems yourself before checking solutions
✅ Understand WHY each solution works
✅ Practice edge cases for every problem
✅ Time yourself on challenges
✅ Redo difficult problems

**Don't**:
❌ Skip "easy" problems (they build intuition!)
❌ Just memorize solutions
❌ Ignore time complexity
❌ Rush through lessons
❌ Give up when stuck (take a break!)

### If You Get Stuck

1. Re-read the explanation
2. Trace through examples step-by-step
3. Try a simpler version first
4. Review earlier week patterns
5. Take a 15-minute break
6. Come back with fresh perspective
