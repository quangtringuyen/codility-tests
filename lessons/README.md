## 🎯 Quick Pattern Reference

### Most Important Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | Time | Lesson |
|---------|-------------|------|--------|
| **Prefix Sum** | Range queries | O(n) build, O(1) query | Week 2 |
| **Stack** | Matching, simulation | O(n) | Week 4 |
| **Kadane's** | Max subarray | O(n) | Week 5 |
| **Boyer-Moore** | Majority element | O(n) | Week 4 |

## 💡 Study Tips

### How to Use These Lessons

**Daily Routine**:
1. **Read the lesson** (20-30 min)
   - Understand concepts thoroughly
   - Take notes on patterns

2. **Practice challenges** (60-90 min)
   - Try solving yourself first
   - Compare with provided solutions
   - Understand WHY solution works

3. **Track progress** (10 min)
   - Use the web app
   - Mark completed tasks
   - Note difficulties

4. **Review** (10-15 min)
   - What did you learn?
   - What was difficult?
   - What to practice more?

### Maximizing Learning

**Do**:
- ✅ Solve problems yourself before looking at solutions
- ✅ Understand the pattern, not just memorize code
- ✅ Practice edge cases
